Ultimate Sitemap Parser was originally developed by `Linus Valiukas <https://valiukas.dev/>`_ and `Thomas Grandjean <https://www.thomasgrandjean.fr/>`_ as part of the `Media Cloud <https://mediacloud.org/>`_ project, incubated at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University and the MIT Media Lab in the Centre for Civic Media.

It is now maintained by the `GATE Team <https://gate.ac.uk/>`_ at the School of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, chiefly by `Freddy Heppell <https://freddyheppell.com/>`_. Development is partially supported by:

- InnovateUK grant number 10039039 (approved under the Horizon Europe Programme as VIGILANT, EU grant agreement number 101073921)
- A University of Sheffield Faculty of Engineering PGR Prize Scholarship
