        Thanks for reporting an issue parsing the sitemap of a specific site. Please provide as much information as possible to help us reproduce this issue.
        
        The easiest way to report site-specific issues is to use the [`usp` CLI tool](https://ultimate-sitemap-parser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/cli.html), which is installed with the package.
        
        Please run the following command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        usp ls -vv -l output.log "https://your-url-here.com" > output.txt
        ```

        If you ran the command as above, you should have an `output.log` (logs) and `output.txt` (the parsed tree) file. We suggest uploading these as a [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/) and linking them here.
